- numaplaces uses the inherited affinity mask

- numaplace maintains a shared memory segment of:
 - structure lock
 - instance structures with:
  > pid of numaplace
  > bitmask of allocated cores

- the structure lock key is the holder's pid
- at each invocation, it deallocates any stale instance structures via pid

- updates are performed via atomic cmpxchg to prevent the need for locking
 > and thus avoids hanging due to being killed before the lock is released
